# Runners with Ranks

Welcome to my GitHub project! This is a small practice project that I created to develop my skills in building RESTful APIs using NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, and Postman. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in designing and implementing APIs, creating robust database schemas, and testing APIs using Postman.

In addition to practicing my technical skills, I am also using this project to learn Git and GitHub. I believe that version control is an essential tool for any developer, and I am excited to be improving my skills in this area.

The focus of this project is on creating an API that displays data on Olympic runners, including their scores, country, ranks, and names. This project challenged me to pay attention to detail, prioritize data validation, security, and scalability.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my project. I hope that it showcases my abilities as a developer and demonstrates my commitment to continuous learning and improvement.
